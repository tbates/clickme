## 0.1.3 -

## 0.1.2 - April 7, 2013

## 0.1.1 - April 6, 2013

* Moved test-translator.R inside the template folder for easier access
* Bug: made %notin% and %||% visible to the translator.R file

## 0.1.0 - April 4, 2013

* Major change in the way templates communicate with R. Before, data was specified using `opts$data`, now you must call individual translate functions in your `translator.R` file. This allows for much greater flexibility and better code organization.
* Rewrite of the `new_ractive` function. Now, translator functions only receive the `opts` object, use `opts$data` instead of `data`.
* Added `clickme_vega` convenience function to use with the Vega ractive.
* Added `create_data_file` convenience function to write an R object to file. It writes csv files using `write.csv` and `writeLines for the rest of extensions (unless overriden). It returns a quote-escaped relative path.
* Added `append_external` convenience function
* Added `open_html` convenience function to open the ractive examples.
* Added `escape_quote` convenience function to surround a string with escaped quotes
* Styles and scripts in template_config.yml must point to existing files
* Allow users to cancel auto-installing required packages
* data_name variable in clickme function is now "data" by default. To make it a random string use NULL.

* The `translate()` function should return opts. That way, if the translator makes changes to the opts variable, they will be visible to the `clickme` function

## 0.0.2 - March 24, 2013

* You can set the CLICKME_ROOT_PATH variable in your .Rprofile to change the default root path
